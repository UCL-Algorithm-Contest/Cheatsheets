\subsection{Bipartite graph}
Check if bipartite
\lstinputlisting{graphs/isBipartite.java}

\subsubsection{Max Cardinality Bipartite Matching (MCBM)}
Pairing of adjacent nodes. No node in two different pairs.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Max Flow.
  \item Augmenting Path: path starting at non matched, ending
    at non-matched, even edges are matching.
    MCBM ssi no augmenting path.
    Start from non-matched, if augmenting path, augment
    (do not have to take all matching in the augmenting path).
\end{itemize}
MCBM : Number of matching.

Hungarian algorithm $O(|V||E|)$:

Hopcroft-Karp algorithm $O(\sqrt{|V|}|E|)$:

\subsubsection{Independent Set (or Dominating Set)}
Set of vertices with no edges between them.
MIS, add a vertex create an edge.
In \textbf{bipartite} graph,
$\text{MIS} + \text{MCBM} = V$.

\subsubsection{Vertex Cover}
Vertices such that each edge is adjacent to at least one vertex.
Min Vertex Cover (MVC). In \textbf{bipartite} graph,
$\text{MVC} = \text{MCBM}$.

In \textbf{general} graph,
$\text{MIS} + \text{MVC} = |V|$ and the MVC is the complementary of MIS.
